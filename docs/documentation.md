## What Goes Where

### `architecture/`

One file per architectural decision. Each document should cover:

- **Context** — what problem the decision addresses
- **Decision** — what was chosen and why
- **Alternatives considered** — what was rejected and why
- **Consequences** — trade-offs accepted

Add a new file when introducing a fundamentally new pattern, technology, or structural choice. These documents should remain stable over
time — they describe _why_ the system is shaped the way it is, not _how_ to use it day-to-day.

### `features/`

One file per user-facing feature, added once the feature is implemented. Each document should cover:

- **User behavior** — what the user sees and does
- **Options considered** — approaches evaluated with pros/cons
- **Option chosen** — the selected approach and rationale
- **Implementation** — key files and data flow for the concrete implementation

Features are different from architecture: architecture describes structural decisions that affect many features; features describe specific
end-to-end functionality built on top of that architecture.

### `conventions.md`

Living document for working agreements: naming, file organization, tooling workflows, things not to touch. Update it whenever a new
convention is established.

### `infrastructure.md`

Deployment pipeline, CI configuration, environment setup. Update it when the deployment or CI process changes.

### `assets/`

Supporting media referenced from other docs (diagrams, screenshots). Name files to match the doc they support (e.g., `state-sync-flow.png`
for `architecture/state-synchronization.md`).
