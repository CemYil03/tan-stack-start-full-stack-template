# Authentication

## Context

The application needs to identify users across requests without requiring an upfront login. Sessions must be established automatically on
first visit and persist across browser sessions.

## Decision

Cookie-based session management with automatic session creation on every GraphQL request.

### How It Works

1. Every request to `/api/graphql` or `/api/stream` calls `sessionUpsert()` before executing the GraphQL operation
2. `sessionUpsert()` reads the session ID from the `draw-schema-session-id` cookie
3. If a valid session exists (not terminated), it updates `lastInteractionAt` and returns the session
4. If no session exists or the session was terminated, a new session is created with `crypto.randomUUID()`
5. The response includes a `Set-Cookie` header to persist the session ID in the browser

### Session Lifecycle

- **Created**: automatically on first request
- **Active**: `lastInteractionAt` updated on every request; `connectionActive` tracks real-time connections
- **Terminated**: soft-deleted via `wasTerminatedAt` timestamp (row is preserved, not deleted)
- **User binding**: `userId` column exists on the session but is nullable — sessions start anonymous and can be linked to a user later

### Key Files

- `src/server/commands/sessionUpsert.ts` — session creation and update logic
- `src/server/utils/sessionUtils.ts` — cookie reading/writing helpers
- `src/server/db/schema.ts` — `Sessions` table definition
- `src/routes/api/graphql.ts` — session context wiring for queries and mutations
- `src/routes/api/stream.ts` — session context wiring for subscriptions

## Alternatives Considered

- **JWT tokens**: Stateless but harder to revoke, no server-side session state for real-time tracking
- **Third-party auth (OAuth providers)**: Adds external dependency; can be layered on top of sessions later

## Consequences

- Every request hits the database for session upsert — acceptable given the PostgreSQL connection pool
- Sessions start anonymous, so user identity requires a separate linking step
- Soft-delete means the sessions table grows over time — will need a cleanup job eventually
